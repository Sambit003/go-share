package files

// This file is intended to house core library functions like UploadFile and DownloadFile.
// Currently, these functions are in their own files (upload.go, download.go) for better organization.
// This file can be removed if no other shared core logic for the 'files' package is immediately planned,
// or it can be populated if such logic emerges.

// Example of a potential shared utility or constant, if needed in the future:
// const MaxFileSize = 1024 * 1024 * 50 // 50 MB

// For now, it remains largely a placeholder or can be removed.
